## Recommended Texts

Covers most bases, but is aging:

Focuses more on open economy issues:

Focuses more on nominal rigidities, and the role of monetary policy:

\[MW\] Woodford, M. *Interest and Prices: Foundations of a Theory of Monetary Policy*. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2003. ISBN: 9780691010496.

Macroeconomics is a rapidly changing field. To get a sense of the geography, you might find it useful to read two surveys (which are already on the verge of obsolescence…):

Blanchard, O. "What Do We Know About Macroeconomics that Fisher and Wicksell Did Not?" *Quarterly Journal of Economics* 115, no. 4 (November 2000): 1375-1410.

Woodford, M. "{{% resource_link "7be70757-62e3-4cab-9a72-60029aa3d402" "Revolution and Evolution in Twentieth-Century Macroeconomics" %}}." Paper presented at Frontiers of the Mind in the Twenty-First Century, U.S. Library of Congress, Washington, DC, June 1999.

For two more recent and more polemical, pieces, you may also want to read:

Chari, V. V. "Modern Macroeconomics in Practice: How Theory is Shaping Policy." *Journal of Economic Perspectives* 20, no. 4 (2006): 3-28.

Mankiw, N. G. "The Macroeconomist as Scientist and Engineer." *Journal of Economic Perspectives* 20, no. 4 (2006): 29-46.
