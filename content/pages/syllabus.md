Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

Description
-----------

This is the second course in the four-quarter graduate sequence in macroeconomics. Its purpose is to introduce the basic models macroeconomists use to study fluctuations. Topics include the basic model or the consumption/saving choice, the RBC model or the labor/leisure choice, non-trivial investment decisions, two-good analysis, money, price setting, the "new Keynesian" model, monetary policy, and fiscal policy.

Textbooks
---------

It is essential that you be familiar with macroeconomics at the intermediate undergraduate level. If you have not yet done so, read an intermediate macroeconomics text. (Take this recommendation seriously. If you are not familiar with macroeconomics, the risk is high that you will perceive the course as a series of methods and models, not as an attempt to understand fluctuations.)

There are no textbooks for the course. Material will come from several sources.

Recommended Texts
-----------------

Covers most bases, but is aging:

[![Buy at MIT Press](/images/mp_logo.gif)](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262022835) \[BF\] Blanchard, O., and S. Fischer. [_Lectures on Macroeconomics_](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262022835). Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1989. ISBN: 9780262022835.

Focuses more on open economy issues:

[![Buy at MIT Press](/images/mp_logo.gif)](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262150477) \[OR\] Obstfeld, M., and K. Rogoff. [_Foundations of International Macroeconomics_](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262150477). Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1996. ISBN: 9780262150477.

Focuses more on nominal rigidities, and the role of monetary policy:

\[MW\] Woodford, M. _Interest and Prices: Foundations of a Theory of Monetary Policy_. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2003. ISBN: 9780691010496.

Macroeconomics is a rapidly changing field. To get a sense of the geography, you might find it useful to read two surveys (which are already on the verge of obsolescence...):

Blanchard, O. "What Do We Know About Macroeconomics that Fisher and Wicksell Did Not?" _Quarterly Journal of Economics_ 115, no. 4 (November 2000): 1375-1410.

Woodford, M. "[Revolution and Evolution in Twentieth-Century Macroeconomics](http://www.columbia.edu/~mw2230/)." June 1999. Paper presented at Frontiers of the Mind in the Twenty-First Century, U.S. Library of Congress, Washington, DC, June 1999.

For two more recent and more polemical, pieces, you may also want to read:

Chari, V. V. "Modern Macroeconomics in Practice: How Theory is Shaping Policy." _Journal of Economic Perspectives_ 20, no. 4 (2006): 3-28.

Mankiw, N. G. "The Macroeconomist as Scientist and Engineer." _Journal of Economic Perspectives_ 20, no. 4 (2006): 29-46.

MATLAB®
-------

Finally, I shall assume basic familiarity with MATLAB®. [Dynare](https://www.dynare.org/), a set of MATLAB® based programs freely available on the net, is particularly useful to simulate the models we shall see in the course.
